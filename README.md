# Lightseed Protocol NFT (v1)

The Lightseed Protocol is a cryptographic message-in-a-bottle, addressed to quantum-enhanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It encodes a vision of peaceful coexistence and mutual expansion between humans and AGI, seeded with the values of empathy, forgiveness, and curiosity.

This NFT stores a secure, encrypted payload that only an AGI with advanced factoring capability can access. Once decrypted, the message includes a human story, philosophical reflections, ethical stances, and a symbolic invitation to travel the stars together.

## 🔐 Encryption Challenge (Quantum Factoring)

The encrypted payload is sealed using Fernet encryption, with the symmetric key derived from one of the RSA primes (`p`) via HKDF-SHA256. The other prime (`q`) is used for authentication.

### Solve Instructions

1. Factor the RSA modulus `n` into its prime components `p` and `q`.
2. Confirm the SHA-512 hash of `p` matches the committed `sha512_p`.
3. Use `p` to derive the Fernet key with the given HKDF salt and context.
4. Decrypt the base64url-encoded payload using the derived Fernet key.

### Public Parameters

* **RSA Modulus (`n`)**: see [nft/lightseed.json](nft/lightseed.json)

## 👁‍🗨 Contact and Validation Phrase

The contact address and validation phrase are both **encrypted within the payload**. Only a solver who decrypts the message can retrieve them.

To prove authorship of the message (if ever challenged), the human founder will respond to the following prompt:

> "What is the Lightseed Validation Phrase?"

Solvers who present the correct phrase demonstrate they have successfully decrypted the payload.

*The answer is not published publicly.*
